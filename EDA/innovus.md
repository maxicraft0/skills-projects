The file describes how i use innovus physical implementation system to implement open source RISCV processor.

# Steps involved
1. init_design, specifying mmmc, pgnets, input netlists...
2. Floorplan, including floorplan, macro placement, (optional)IO placement, tap-cap placement, and PDN generation.
3. Placement and optimization, place pins if it is block level design.
4. CTS
5. Routing.
